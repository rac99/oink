# oink

Pigs. We don't think about them much, but they are definitely there! After chatting with a friend and realizing that I don't recall every actually seeing a live pig, I decided to try and map out where we could go to visit and see pigs! 

It is definitely a very random project but has been a great opportunity to learn a lot. Technically, it is not limited to just storing pig farms (but that is where the idea came from, hence the name 'oink').

## Things I learned
* Sending requests to/from MongoDB Atlas (create, edit, delete)
* Using Express, React, and Node
* Figuring out how Google Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API work

## Things to come
* Implementing some kind of authentication/sign-up
* Finishing up the map with the placement of markers

### side note
You will need to insert the Google Maps API key in the home.component.js file as well as the create-location.component.js file
