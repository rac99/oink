Pigs. We don't think about them much, but they are definitely there! After chatting with [Peter](https://github.com/plin0009) and realizing that I don't recall every actually seeing a live pig, I decided to try and map out where we could go to visit and see pigs! (Check out Peter's page for a lot of other cool stuff!). 

It is definitely a very random project but has been a great opportunity to learn a lot. This is still a **work in progress**, but below I have listed some of the ongoing work:

## Things I learned
* First time using the MERN stack 
* Figuring out how to use Google Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API

## Things to come
* Implementing some kind of authentication/sign-up
* Finishing up the map with all the markers

### side note
You will need to insert the API key in the home.component.js file as well as the create-location.component.js file
